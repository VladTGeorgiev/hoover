# Description

A script evaluating the effectiveness of an imaginary hoover cleaning dirt patches using 2D coordinate system.
To be able to calculate the number of dirt patches cleaned, the user will have to provide room dimensions, 
hoover starting position, dirt patches' positions and navigating instructions.
See ##Input Requirements for more info.
